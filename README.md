# 🌊 Flood Classification Using Ensemble Learning: Case Study on Malaysia & Kerala

This project focuses on predicting flood events using real-world datasets from **Malaysia** and **Kerala (India)**. We applied multiple machine learning models, including ensemble methods, to compare the performance and behavior across these two regions.

The goal is to build a reliable classifier that can help authorities assess flood risk based on historical patterns and environmental features.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Problem**: Flooding remains one of the most frequent and devastating natural disasters in Southeast Asia. Early classification helps mitigate damage.
- **Approach**: We trained and evaluated various ML models — including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Voting Classifier — on two datasets representing different geographies.
- **Outcome**: The ensemble-based models showed promising results, with improved accuracy and stability across both datasets.

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Voting Classifier (Ensemble)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

We used multiple metrics to evaluate each model:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

Results are compared across both datasets to observe consistency and generalizability.

## 📊 Datasets

1. **Kerala Dataset**  
   Source: [Original project repo](https://github.com/Lexuz17/Kerala_Flood_Classification_Prediction)  
   Features: Rainfall, River level, Temperature, Humidity, etc.

2. **Malaysia Dataset**  
   Collected separately, structured similarly for consistency.  
   Represents flood-related data in key regions of Malaysia.
